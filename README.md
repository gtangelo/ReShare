# ReShare

ReShare is a simple web application that is designed as a trading/sharing platform between users. It uses Python Flask as its infrastructure to allow users to create an account, sell or buy items. 

As seen with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, common household items such as toilet paper can be made scarce. Therefore, the purpose of ReShare is to act as a simple trading platform, where users who are feeling generous can post up items as donations to other users seeking these items immediately. With the scarcity of some products, all users are only able to purchase one item to prevent scalping of such items.

This web application is meant to be a simplified version of other selling platforms (i.e. eBay) and is intended for myself to experiment using APIs and databases for the first time.
